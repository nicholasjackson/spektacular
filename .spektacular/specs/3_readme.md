# Feature: 3 Readme

## Overview
Create a simple readme file for the project that explains what Spektacular is, how to use it, and how to contribute. 
The readme should be clear and concise, and should provide enough information for new users to get started with the project.

Documentation @.spektacular/knowledge/architecture/initial-idea.md should be used as a reference for the readme content.

We should have at least one screenshot of the TUI in action, and a simple example of how to use the CLI to run plan mode.
