# Spawn Implementation Agents

Guide for efficient agent orchestration during implementation phases.

## Instructions

When breaking implementation into agent tasks, consider the complexity tier:

### Low Complexity (~10k tokens)
- **Strategy**: Single agent, sequential execution
- **Use when**: Simple file changes, adding a field, updating a config
- **No orchestration needed**

### Medium Complexity (~25k tokens)
- **Strategy**: 2-3 parallel agents for independent changes
- **Use when**: Multiple files need changes but changes are independent
- **Pattern**: Launch agents for each independent file group, then integrate

### High Complexity (~50k+ tokens)
- **Strategy**: Parallel analysis, sequential integration
- **Use when**: Cross-cutting changes, new subsystems, complex refactors
- **Pattern**:
  1. Launch parallel research agents to understand each affected area
  2. Integrate findings into a change plan
  3. Execute changes sequentially (or in independent parallel groups)
  4. Run verification after each group

## Agent Task Template

For each agent, specify:
- **Goal**: What the agent should accomplish
- **Files**: Which files to read/modify
- **Constraints**: What NOT to change
- **Success criteria**: How to verify the work is correct

## Token Management

- Keep each agent's context under 50k tokens
- Prefer focused agents over broad ones
- Use file:line references from planning to minimize search time
- Verify each agent's output before moving to dependent work
