# What this skill does

This skill drives a **multi-step interactive workflow** that produces a complete specification file in `.spektacular/specs/<name>.md`. The workflow is owned by the `{{command}}` CLI, not by you — the CLI is the state machine and you are the executor.

On each turn, the CLI returns JSON containing an `instruction` field. That instruction describes exactly one step (e.g. overview, requirements, acceptance criteria, …). You must:

1. Read the `instruction` carefully.
2. Perform the step — usually this means interviewing the user, capturing their answers, and writing the relevant section of the spec file.
3. When the step is complete, run the `goto` command named at the bottom of the instruction to advance the state machine.
4. Read the next `instruction` from the new JSON response and repeat.

**This is a loop. Do not stop after the first step.** Keep looping — step → goto → next instruction → step — until a returned instruction tells you the workflow is *finished*. Only then should you report completion to the user.

# How to start

Spec name: $ARGUMENTS

If no spec name was provided, ask the user for one before proceeding.

Start the spec workflow by running:

```
{{command}} spec new --data '{"name": "<spec_name>"}'
```

This creates the spec file and state file automatically and returns the first `instruction`. From that point on, follow the loop above: do what the instruction says, then call `{{command}} spec goto --data '{"step":"<next_step>"}'` to get the next one. Do not invent step names — every instruction tells you the exact `goto` command to run next.
